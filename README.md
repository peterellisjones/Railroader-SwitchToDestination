# Railroader Mod: SwitchToDestination

![](/Capture.PNG)

This mod adds a button to the frieght car operations tab to open all switches between the car's current location and its destination. Notes:

* If there are multiple destination tracks (like the two tracks at Whittier Saw Mill), pressing the button again will toggle between the tracks. (known bug: this doesn't currently work correctly at Alarka Junction -- it will always route to the same track)
* If a change in direction / switchback is required to get to the destination, it will just route to where you need to change directions.. When you get there then you can press it again to open the switches in the opposite direction to take you up the switchback. Don't forget to set fusees so you don't miss the turn!
* It does not route switches for repair or sell waybills, just ones in the operations tab.
* It doesn't know what your other trains are doing, so be careful you don't accidentally move switches other trains are using
