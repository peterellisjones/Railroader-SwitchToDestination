# Railroader Mod: SwitchToDestination

![](/Capture.PNG)

This mod adds a button to the frieght car operations tab to open all switches between the car's current location and it's destination. Notes:

* If a change in direction / switchback is required to get to the destination, it will just route to where you need to change directions.. When you get there then you can press it again to open the switches in the opposite direction to take you up the switchback. Don't forget to set fusees to stop you missing the turning!
* If there are multiple destination tracks (like the two track at Whittier Saw Mill), pressing the button again will toggle between the tracks.
* It does not route switches for repair or sell waybills, just ones in the operations tab.
